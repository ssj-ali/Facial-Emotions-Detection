# Facial-Emotions-Detection
It's my first try on Neural network. My idea is to make an android app that detects facial emotions of the user and displays the content accordingly. Lol;)
Currently it detects only three expressions i.e Happy, Angry & Sad. I am working on it to make it more precise and then I will add more emotions.

## Steps:
1. Install Python (Anaconda recommended for Windows)
2. Install all the necessary modules like numpy. Most likely, you will get all thse libraries preinstalled if you are using Anaconda.
3. After installing Anaconda, run Anaconda command prompt
4. Copy paste these two lines:
'''
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
'''
